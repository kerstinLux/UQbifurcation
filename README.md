# UQbifurcation
This repository contains the code used to generate the results in "Uncertainty Quantification of Bifurcations in Random Ordinary Differential Equations", which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05581. Please cite the preprint when using the material in this repository.

The respository is structured such that each Figure (Fig) content is self-contained (including all auxiliary functions needed). The code is written in MATLAB R2019a/b.
The MATLAB-based framework for uncertainty quantifcation "UQLab" is used to perform the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and to sample therefrom. It is available under https://www.uqlab.com/.

To run the code please use the corresponding main_figX file.
