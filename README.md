# UQbifurcation
This repository contains the code used to generate the results in "Uncertainty Quantification of Bifurcations in Random Ordinary Differential Equations", which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05581. Please cite the preprint when using the material in this repository.

The code is written in MATLAB R2019a/b. The respository is structured such that each Figure (Fig) can be generated by running the "main_figX" file in the corresponding "FigX" folder. The auxiliary functions needed must additionally be integrated in the same folder as the main file. They need to be gathered from the folders "files_figX". This is because several figures share the same auxiliary functions.

Please note that the MATLAB-based framework for uncertainty quantifcation "UQLab" is used to perform the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and to sample therefrom. It is available under https://www.uqlab.com/.
