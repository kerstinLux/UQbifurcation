# UQbifurcation
This repository contains the code used to generate the results in "Assessing the Impact of Parametric Uncertainty on Tipping points of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation", which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15859. Please cite this publication when using the material in this repository.

The code is written in MATLAB R2019a/b. The respository is structured such that each figure can be generated by running the corresponding main file.

Please note that the MATLAB-based framework for uncertainty quantifcation "UQLab" is used to perform the Bayesian inference procedure. It is available under https://www.uqlab.com/.
